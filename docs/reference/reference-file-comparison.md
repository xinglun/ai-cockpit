# Reference file comparison

This page explains how the Rust project compares itself with the public
reference source one file at a time. The reference is a specification and
behavior corpus; it is not a directory to copy into the Rust Runtime.

## Pinned baseline

- Reference: [`spirex-ds-dev/ai-cockpit-template`](https://github.com/spirex-ds-dev/ai-cockpit-template) at `e5acb677da6621004d96f0ef353c58fe8d3acfbf`.
- Rust comparison baseline: [`xinglun/ai-cockpit`](https://github.com/xinglun/ai-cockpit) `origin/main` at `46e426625a8cae450f1190d0bdbafd6d8e648a90`.
- Runtime used for the comparison work: `ai-cockpit 0.2.27`, binary SHA256 `ea9a4a090307cb650eeda008942a5bc72fd0d1276b131405868f31d1eabcc048`.

The machine-readable ledger is
[`reference_file_inventory.json`](../../tests/conformance/reference_file_inventory.json).
Its regression check requires one classification for every tracked reference
path and rejects an unclassified first-batch path.

## Classification rules

- **implemented-equivalent** — the same reader or governance responsibility is
  present with the same effective boundary.
- **implemented-different-by-design** — the responsibility exists, but Rust
  Protocol, the shared external Runtime, or an explicit Agent adapter owns it
  at a different path or abstraction.
- **migrate-gap** — a concrete responsibility has no accepted counterpart and
  needs a bounded remediation.
- **not-applicable** — the reference file is outside this Runtime's product
  boundary.
- **reference-only** — the file is retained as explanatory or conformance
  material, not as current Runtime behavior.
- **generated-history** — immutable reference history or generated projection;
  it is never copied or silently rewritten.
- **deferred-next-batch** — the path is recorded but its semantic comparison is
  intentionally scheduled for a later batch. This is not a claim of parity or
  omission.

## First batch: governance entrypoints

The first batch covers root Agent rules, `.ai` entrypoints and terminology,
reader-facing README and architecture routes, and the reference governance
configuration entrypoints. The Rust project keeps the important boundaries but
does not copy the reference's Python runtime, Makefile targets, YAML guard
tree, provider-global rules, or generated history.

| Reference surface | Rust result | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, Cursor rule | Implemented differently | The repository uses an attached adapter and explicit provider installation. The shared Runtime remains external; no provider-global configuration is injected by comparison. |
| `.ai/README.md`, glossary, cockpit workflow/adoption guides | Implemented differently | `.ai/README.md`, `.ai/glossary.md`, `docs/reference/agent-workflow.*`, and the getting-started route carry the Rust request-scoped Runtime workflow. |
| Reference guards, policies, quality and trust schemas | Implemented differently | Typed Rust Protocol/Runtime services, repository tests, CI manifests, and reference documentation provide the corresponding controls. The source YAML/JSON files are not copied. |
| Root and documentation README routes | Implemented differently | The three language routes link to one another and describe shared Runtime plus isolated repository contexts. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Implemented equivalently with Rust-specific additions | The security boundary remains a policy entrypoint and includes the Runtime deployment/patch boundary. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Implemented in this batch | Contributor rules now describe the explicit `--repo` lifecycle, fail-closed evidence, visible Outcome, reviewed PR, and exact post-merge cleanup. |
| Reference generated Work Items, decisions, evidence, audits and release history | Generated-history | These bytes remain reference history and are not copied into the Rust repository. |

The first batch therefore closes the only concrete entrypoint gap found in the
baseline (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) without creating a second governance system. The
remaining paths are explicitly staged in the ledger for the next semantic
batches rather than silently treated as equivalent.

## Batch order

Later batches will compare and, where necessary, implement bounded differences
in this order:

1. Contract fields, intent, scenario/acceptance dimensions, parallel slots and
   preflight review.
2. CI quality routing, dynamic verification tiers, and evidence assurance.
3. Runtime lifecycle, Outcome/MCP projection, recovery, knowledge, and
   repository isolation.
4. Conformance, adversarial cases, performance, release, and adopter
   acceptance.

Each batch gets its own Contract and evidence. After a batch is reviewed and
published, the next batch is rechecked with the published Runtime so that a
working-tree change cannot masquerade as release behavior.
